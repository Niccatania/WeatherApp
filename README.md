# WeatherApp
This weather app allows you to search for a city and get weather for that city. This includes the daily foreecast as well as the five days ahead.

# Goal

This projects goal was to use API's to retrieve data and display it. I accomplished this by using the geocoding API, combined with the one call weather API. This gives us current weather data, as well as weather data for the next five days. The coordinates are generated from a search of a city by the geocoding API and then inserted from local storage into the one call API. This returns our data, which we then add to the DOM.
